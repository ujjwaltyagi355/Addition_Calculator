# Addition_Calculator

This is a webapp which is build using basic `HTML`, `JavaScript`, `Node.js` and `Express.js`.<br/>
This web app has a really simple UI but it does _all calculations on the server_(i.e. local device) rather that brower side processing.</br>
This module is implementations of basic server side developement(_Back-End_) using Express.Js.
